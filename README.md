# MoodJournal
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

Mood Journal is a feature-rich, client-side web application built with Angular. It provides a beautiful and intuitive interface for tracking your daily moods, writing journal entries, and visualizing your emotional well-being over time. All data is stored locally in your browser's local storage, ensuring your privacy.

Features:

Daily Mood Logging: Select from a range of moods (e.g., Ecstatic, Happy, Sad, Angry) and add a descriptive note about your day.

Interactive Calendar: View your mood history on a monthly calendar, with emojis representing your entries.

Weekly Trends Chart: Visualize your mood scores over the last seven days with a simple and colorful bar chart.

Client-Side Storage: Your journal entries are automatically saved to your browser's localStorage. No backend or database is required.

Edit & Delete: Click on any day in the calendar to open a modal where you can view, edit, or delete the corresponding entry.

Dual Theme: Switch between a light and a dark theme for comfortable viewing at any time of day.

Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
